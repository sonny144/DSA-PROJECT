Adding A Track 
For Empty Playlist: 
START
 Read track
   IF front ==null // checks to see if the playlist is empty
   Front = newNode (track)
   Rear =newNode(track)
   ENDIF 
END

Add After Another Track:
START
Read track
 IF prev_node ==null
 DISPLAY “The previous track cannot be null”
ENDIF
 new_node = track  // puts the data into the new node 
 new_node.nextAddress =prev_node.nextAddress // make the next of the new track as the next of previous track
 prev_node.nextAddress = new_node // make the next of the previous track as  the new track now
 new_node.prevAddress = prev_node // makes previous track as previous of new track
 IF (new_node.nextAddress!=null) THEN // now changes the next of the previous track
new_node.next.prevAddress = new_node
 ENDIF
END




Add at the end of the playlist
START
 Read track
  new_node = track // put the data into the node 
   current_node  = head
   new_node.nextAddress = null; // since it will be going to end , the next must point to null
   IF head == null
        new_node. prevAddress = null // if playlist is empty , the new track must go to the    front
        head = new_node(track)
    ENDIF
     WHILE current_node.next ! =null THEN // will go through playlist until it finds the last track
    current_node = current_node. next 
     ENDWHILE
      current_node.nextAddress = track // changes the next of the last track
       new_node.prevAddress = currentnode // makes the last track the previous of the newly added track
END
